# **Sandwich Driven Development**

### Step 1 - Protect your code with Approval Tests before start Refactoring :

Refactoring is changing the structure of your code in order to improve it without changing its logic and behaviour.

One of the bad practices in Refactoring is to do it without covering your code with tests.

To write tests, you need probably someone/some documentation to understand the code and its logic.
It also takes time to prevent your code for any case.

What if we have any way to understand the code ?
Hopefully there is Approval Tests to help us in this case.
With Approval Tests we can write rapidly a bunch of tests to protect our code a minimum which allows us to start refactoring the code and understanding its logic.
Obviously we need other types of tests (ex: Unit Tests) to protect ou code correctly.

#### Where to start ?

So let's have a look to https://approvaltests.com/platforms/ Website. Then choose your implementation and try to implement Approval Tests for the Recruitment System.
