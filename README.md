# **Sandwich Driven Development**

### Step 6 - Make your Domain Model Completeness

When the domain layer contains all business logic, the Domain Model is Completeness.
The Domain Model we are working with is not Completeness as we have some business logics outside our Domain layer. Could you find these business rules ?

### What to do ?

Try to make move business logics that are outside the Domain Model to make it Completeness respecting Sandwich Pattern.
