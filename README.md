# **Sandwich Driven Development**

In this hands-on training session, we try to solve a very common problem in software development teams, that is, a legacy procedural code without tests.

The idea is to protect our code thanks to Approval Tests and try to Refactor this procedural code to a domain centric one.
The aim is to follow good practices to finally reach services that correspond to the Sandwich pattern and coherent rich domain objects containing business behaviours.

Behind the scenes, we try to respond to the following questions :
- What is a pure and isolated Domain ?
- How to know if a Domain is Completeness ?
- What is the difference between an Application Service & a Domain Service ?
- Does Sandwich pattern helps us to make clean Domain Services ?
